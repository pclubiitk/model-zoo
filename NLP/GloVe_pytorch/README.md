# Summary

## Introduction
GloVe, standing for Global Vectors is a powerful word vector learning technique. One of the major revolutionising technique after word2vec. For newbies, word vectors put words to a nice vector space, where similar words cluster together and different words repel. This helps in understanding and grouping words in order of their similarity in various dimensions. The major advantage of GloVe over word2vec is that it not only relies on local statistics(word-context), but also the global statistics(word-coocurence). Word2Vec only focused on the local company.

## Problem with word2vec
Being local learner, its semantics are only affect by surroundings. So, in a sentence like
> The boy plays with the ball.

It would not understand whether 'the' is a special word inh context of boy and ball, or a mere article (enter your school GRAMMAR..lol) for common sentences. This wouldnt be case if it is also gathering global information of all different sentences and words.

## The GloVe approach
GloVe suggests that ***You can derive semantic relationships between words from the co-occurrence matrix.*** Given a corpus having V words, the co-occurrence matrix X will be a V x V matrix, where the i th row and j th column of X, X_ij denotes how many times word i has co-occurred with word j. An example co-occurrence matrix might look as follows.
<p align="center">
  <img width="371" height="310" src="assets/paper4.PNG">
</p>

To understand how this matrix helps in semantic similarity, the paper provides an example table:

<p align="center">
  <img width="570" height="127" src="assets/paper1.PNG">
</p>

Consider the entity **P_ik/P_jk** where **P_ik = X_ik/X_i**.

Here P_ik denotes the probability of seeing word i and k together, which is computed by dividing the number of times i and k appeared together (X_ik) by the total number of times word i appeared in the corpus (X_i).
You can see that given two words, i.e. ice and steam, if the third word k (also called the “probe word”),

* is very similar to ice but irrelevant to steam (e.g. k=solid), P_ik/P_jk will be very high (>1),

* is very similar to steam but irrelevant to ice (e.g. k=gas), P_ik/P_jk will be very small (<1),

* is related or unrelated to either words, then P_ik/P_jk will be close to 1.

So, if we can find a way to incorporate P_ik/P_jk to computing word vectors we will be achieving the goal of using global statistics when learning word vectors.

## Mathematics Part & Loss function
Noting that the ratio Pik /Pjk depends on three words i, j, and k,the most general model takes the form,
<p align="center">
  <img width="178" height="60" src="assets/paper6.PNG">
</p>
But since we are dealing with vectors and want to compare for two entities i and j, their vector difference can serve the purpose as input in function. This can be seen from example that w_king - w_queen + w_girl should be w_boy logically.
<p align="center">
  <img width="212" height="54" src="assets/paper2.PNG">
</p>
Moreover, the input are vectors but output is scalar, so dot product of the two vectors in the following fashion can serve the purpose whilst not hampering with vector dimenions. 
<p align="center">
  <img width="236" height="59" src="assets/paper2.PNG">
</p>
The function should be invariant under labelling, hence we can write this like 
<p align="center">
  <img width="246" height="65" src="assets/paper7.PNG">
</p>
to serve the purpose. This is solved by taking
<p align="center">
  <img width="246" height="65" src="assets/paper8.PNG">
</p>
Now the solution to F is exponential, hence
<p align="center">
  <img width="313" height="40" src="assets/paper9.PNG">
</p>
Now adding biases, the target equation becomes
<p align="center">
  <img width="241" height="37" src="assets/paper10.PNG">
</p>

The proposed **cost function** is weighted mean square error : 
<p align="center">
  <img width="362" height="74" src="assets/paper11.PNG">
</p>
where V is the size of the vocabulary. The weighting function should obey the following properties:

1. *f(0) = 0. If f is viewed as a continuous function, it should vanish as x → 0 fast enough that the limx→0 f (x) log2 x is finite.*

2. *f(x) should be non-decreasing so that rare co-occurrences are not overweighted.*

3. *f(x) should be relatively small for large values of x, so that frequent co-occurrences are not overweighted.*

Although many f(x) exists for solving the purpose,the one used by GloVe is

In the paper, ***alpha = 0.75*** and ***x_max = 100*** have been considered.
