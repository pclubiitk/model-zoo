# Model Summary:

##  Introduction:

Convolutional neural networks have emerged as the master algorithm in computer vision in recent years, and developing recipes for designing them has been a subject of considerable attention. The history of convolutional neural network design started with LeNet-style models, which were simple stacks of convolutions for feature extraction and max-pooling operations for spatial sub-sampling. In 2012, these ideas were refined into the AlexNet architecture, where convolution operations were being repeated multiple times in-between max-pooling operations, allowing the network to learn richer features at every spatial scale.

The fundamental building block of Inception-style models is the Inception module, of which several different versions exist. In figure 1 we show the canonical form of an Inception module, as found in the Inception V3 architecture. An Inception model can be understood as a stack of such modules. This is a departure from earlier VGG-style networks which were stacks of simple convolution layers.

The Xception is the extreme version of the Inception model which basically involves depthwose seperable convolutions and standard convolutions operations. 

## Model Architecture:

In short, the Xception architecture is a linear stack of depthwise separable convolution layers with residual connections. This makes the architecture very easy to define and modify; it takes only 30 to 40 lines of code using a highlevel library such as Keras or TensorFlow-Slim , not unlike an architecture such as VGG-1, but rather un-like architectures such as Inception V2 or V3 which are far more complex to define.

Some of the basic features of the Xception model from standard depthwise convs:

* The order of the operations: depthwise separable convolutions as usually implemented perform first channel-wise spatial convolution and then perform 1x1 convolution, whereas Inception performs
the 1x1 convolution first.
* The presence or absence of a non-linearity after the
first operation. In Inception, both operations are followed by a ReLU non-linearity, however depthwise separable convolutions are usually implemented without non-linearities.

## Implementation:

* Implemented the XCeption Mode on CIFAR10 dataset which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
* Initially started the training process for 10 epochs using model.fit() method and obtained a training accuracy of 87%
* Obtained an accuracy of 81% on the test data.
