## Summary
### Introduction
SRGAN is the Single Image Super Resolution using a GAN which essentially is a fine tuned version of RResNet. Both are Generative Modes to create a high resolution image from a low resolution image. 
### What's New?
Super Resolution received substantial attention from within the computer
vision research community and has a wide range of
applications. The optimization target of supervised
SR algorithms is commonly the minimization of the mean
squared error (MSE) between the recovered HR image
and the ground truth. This is convenient as minimizing
MSE also maximizes the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
which is a common measure used to evaluate and compare
SR algorithms. However, the ability of MSE (and
PSNR) to capture perceptually relevant differences, such
as high texture detail, is very limited as they are defined
based on pixel-wise image difference. Hence, to capure those details, SRGAN define a novel perceptual loss using high-level feature maps of the VGG network
combined with a discriminator that encourages solutions
perceptually hard to distinguish from the HR reference
images.

### Loss Functions
we have the following loss functions:\

**PixelWise MSE Loss**\

**Content Loss**\

**Adversarial Loss**\

### Training Details
Paper uses a generator trained with a SRResNet setup. We pre-train the generator using MSE Loss to replicate that.
After that we use the content loss, Perceptual Loss, and Adersarial Loss to train the GAN. A video showing the training process is provided [here](assets/train_video.avi) or [here is a youtube link](https://youtu.be/q9-AX0yMbzw).
We used DIV2K dataset taking 96x96 sized patchs as high resolution image with 4x scale, taking a batch of 128 patchs.
### Results
A random image was selected from the dataset and was monitered over the process of training.\

### Losses over the training.
**Pre-Training**\

The model was pre-trained over the training part of DIV2K dataset for 1000 iterations.(only 600 were recorded properly)
