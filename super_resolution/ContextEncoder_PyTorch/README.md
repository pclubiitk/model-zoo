## Summary 

Feature inpainting in simple words,means that you are using some "entity" to fill in images which have empty spaces in them.This field has been around for a long time,and it used computer vision to solve the problem. In this paper,we attempt to do the same using convolutional neural networks,and involve some concepts taken from GANs to make the results better.

The concept of using a convolutional network to model inpainting in the form of a generator and discriminator has been taken from [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434),and using a encoder-decoder network as a part of the generator from the [VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114).Lets take a dive into the finer aspects of this paper.

## Basic architecture :

Like most GAN architectures,it contains a Generator and a Discriminator,Let's divide them into two seperate parts:

### Generator :

The generator itself consists of two parts,which are similiar to the encoder and decoder network as mentioned in the VAE paper linked above. An input image consisting of a blank part(we use slicing to split the image into two parts,a complete image except for a blank space in the picture,and the corresponding smaller picture,that would perfectly fill that gap)(The aim of the network is to fill this blank part with a comprehensible image) is fed into the "encoder",which uses convolutional downsampling(No Maxpool layers,all reductions in dimensions are provided by taking stride > 1 ).This encoding converts the image into a compressed representation of itself. This encoded output is then fed into the "decoder" which reconstructs the blank part of the image.The image is reconstructed using upsampling layers,drawing inspiration from the DCGAN paper linked above.


### Discriminator : 

The discriminator is a standard discriminator mentioned in the DCGAN paper,it takes in the predicted image from the generator,and classifies it as real(1) or fake (0),using a convolutional net involving downsampling using striding(Once again,no pooling layers are used).


## The loss function :

The loss functon used in the network looks somewhat like this : 

![loss](./assets/loss_function.png)

Let's take it step by step.There are 2 losses involved here,L_adv and L_rec.L_rec is a standard MSE loss,in which the arguments are :

- The predicted image by the generator
- The ground truth image which we get after processing the Dataset.

This loss penalizes the network if the output is not approximately close enough to the real picture(Pixelwise loss is calcaulted).

L_adv is the BCE loss function commonly used in GANs to discriminate between real and fake generators.

L_adv ensures the sharpness and relevance of the image. As an example,take a look at this:

## Model Specifications and training :

- The neural nets were trained on the CelebA dataset,with the following specifications : 

  - train batch size : 64
  - Test batch size  : 16
  - dataset split : (5000(Test)/195000(Train))

- Model Specifications : 
  
  - inputs were reshaped to (128,128) pixels,and the mask size(length and width of the blank space) used was 64.
  - The model architecture can be found in the code.The architecture adheres to the rules set in the DCGAN paper.

- Optimizer specifications :

  - `optim.Adam` rules!.Both the discriminator and the generator used adam optimizers,with learning rates of 1e-4 and 2.5e-4 respectively.Both shared a common 
     beta initialization of (.5,.99)

- Runtime specifications : 

  - The model trained for 12 epochs or so, and it took about a good 2 hours for that to happen (The models were trained on Colab GPU's).We used a tensorboard logger to display the losses and the results on the test data as it trained.

## Loss graphs : 

The losses were mapped as follows :

total generator loss(Combines both pixelwise and adversarial loss ) :

Pixel Wise loss for generator :

Adversarial loss for generator:

Fake loss (How well the discriminator classifies fake samples as fake):

Fake loss (How well the discriminator classifies real samples as real):

Total discriminator loss :

## Results :

the first two rows in each image correspond to the real images,while the next two rows correspond to generated images.
(You can tell I'm not cheating because the generator made Zac Efron a woman, and I don't have the imagination to pull that off)
